# ODTKRA
Uses the Oculus Debug Tool to keep your rift from going to sleep

I made this to keep my rift from going to sleep while using mm0zct's Oculus_Touch_Steam_Link Driver

Instructions:
- Download the exe file in releases.

- Run exe after starting Touch Link or Driver4VR (depending on what software you are running)

- Let ODTKRA do its thing and do not touch the Oculus Debug tool, it is supposed to be minimized.

- Your headset will now not go to sleep, if it does, restart ODTKRA.
